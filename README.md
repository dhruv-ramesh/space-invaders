# Space Invaders

I built this project while following along the associated chapters in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. This was mainly an exercise for familiarizing myself with vim. The requirements.txt file can be used to create a conda environment and lists all dependencies for the project. You can clone this repo into your local machine and start the game by using "python3 alien_invasion.py" in the terminal within the folder.
